Candidates record themselves answering popular interview questions, then upload their videos for review. They can rewatch their own content and have Beeready.io coaches provide professional feedback about how to improve. The site they wanted to design would offer several types of profiles for its users including: . | Coach | User Coaches use their version of the interface to create video interviews with their own questions. They send these for their candidates to respond to. When they receive videos from candidates, they can provide feedback via text or with another video. | . Users can play an interview provided by their coach, watch or read coach feedback and replay any videos they sent or received. After planning out their desired site functionality, Beeready.io needed an easy, cost-effective way to add video. They wanted a centralized, reliable solution that would allow them to keep videos viewable by only a client and coach. ",

He appreciated that api.video handles the difficult parts of transcoding, hosting and delivering video. Nicolas taught himself what he needed to know for his implementation and was able to figure out the rest with help from api.video’s incredibly responsive support team.

    "content": "When InEvent decided to produce virtual events, they knew that they would need a way to offer live streams. They needed to be able to reach thousands of people with high quality video footage in real-time and provide that video for on-demand playback later. “We have customers doing multiple sessions at the same time and they have thousands of users watching those sessions. We needed a platform to do a quick RTMP to HLS stream option that we could use on the fly. That’s what api.video does. We needed recordings with adaptive streaming quality. We chose you guys to be one of the providers, because we are growing and we need to have multiple providers for different locations,” said Mauricio Giordano, CTO of InEvent. Using api.video, InEvent was able to quickly set up high quality live streams and make use of the recording feature, which allows for high quality HLS playback. InEvent uses WebRTC for a number of their sessions, but in order to broadcast those sessions to hundreds or thousands of people, they use an RTMP stream. And it’s this stream that gets saved so event attendees can come back to rewatch event sessions later or catch a session that they couldn’t attend in real time. “We create a composite video from a webRTC session. Let’s say you have a meeting with 4 or 5 people, we need to get the video feed of each person and compile them into a layout. Then we need to create an RTMP stream. Then, you guys give us an HLS that we can distribute to thousands of people,” Giordano explained. ",

Their virtual event capabilities will be offered as part of their in-person events.

They started with Wix and Zoom. Wix’s easy-to-use interface made it possible for them to create their own ecommerce site and Zoom allowed them to live stream all of their classes to a small group. There was just one problem - the live streams. While they were great for live teaching, they wanted to offer customers a high quality playback of each class as well as create a backup if anything happened with their Zoom recording.

Valentina used to be a ballerina in the national state ballet in Russia,” Didier said. To bring the couple’s vision to life, Didier set up an ecommerce website with Wix and then turned to setting up their classes. For the video recording implementation, he set up Zoom meetings with recording enabled. Next, he created a live stream with api.video, then added it to the Zoom meeting. Any time Valentina opened Zoom to start live streaming a class, she would speak with the class, then when it was time to begin, she cut everyone’s mics but her own, started her live stream with api.video, and then with Zoom. Didier described the typical class set up for us: “The teacher has the camera filming giving the lesson and at the same time she can see the gallery of Zoom for the images of the students. All our members are not doing live at the same time and we advise them to make live classes sometimes just to participate so we can give feedback. But we mainly use the replay and that’s the reason why also we use api.video – because we need to provide them with high quality video for the replay.” . They decided to offer the Zoom playback alongside the high-quality api.video playback. Students had access to either playback as many times as they wanted for one week after the class. ",

They have now been in business for one year, and they offer classes in nine different disciplines, with subscription and a la carte purchasing models available. They have multiple channels for their live streams, and they’ve not only made it possible for students to take classes from anywhere, but to do so affordably. A monthly subscription to classes starts at 35 euros while others charge double with lower video quality. Individual classes start at 15 euros. Another perk the couple found is that they can teach the classes from anywhere. They also found their no-code implementation tremendously valuable because it meant they could manage the site on their own. “We never had any developer. I didn’t know how to make a website one year ago. I do everything by myself…It’s really cool…For us it’s very important because we are autonomous and we can do things…ourselves,” Didier told us. By not needing a developer except for some help with a menu arrangement in Wix, Didier said they are able to keep costs low, quickly respond to problems and implement improvements. “It would be very complicated for us if we had to ask a web agency or web developer to work for us. Since one year I have made so many changes and we are really in A/B testing mode. I put something, I see a change, I correct it,” Didier said. The couple hopes to grow their digital academy over time, with more classes and teachers, and they look forward to doing so with the help of api.video. “api.video will help us to evolve.” –Didier Duffas .
